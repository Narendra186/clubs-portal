<b>Main moto of Clubsportal</b><br>
The Clubsportal,IIIT Sricity was founded in October 2017, by a dedicated group of faculty, staff and students. The aim was to promote listening to classical music amidst campus residents, students included. Several stalwarts have performed at this acoustically and aesthetically structured Central Lecture Theatre (CLT) to sizable audiences observing pin drop silence. Looking for subtleties, nuances, peace and quite? Well, this is where you should attend a music concert. And when we say stalwarts, we mean it. Whom do you want - Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagvathar, D.K.Pattammal, Lalgudi Jayaraman, Balamuralikrishna. Well, the list can go on. Many have performed under this banner and have appreciated our audience.

But, there is a flip slide to it too. We suffer a drought - of audience from time to time. We have had cycles of house-full CLT with audience squatting on the steps and stage - we have have also faced the embarrassment of seeing more members in the performing troupe than in the audience! The pleasure and pangs of running such an exclusive club will continue. But those who look back at campus life later, will count on Music Club as one of the nice things they miss/missed out on!

Highlights Classfest - In early August, every year - a festival of concerts by popular artists.
Youthfest - In early January, every year a festival of concerts by young, promising musicians.Lorem ninja ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.
